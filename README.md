# SPA2099 HR Health Dashboard

## Overview
Static prototype for the SPA2099 HR Health experience, including leadership summary views and a live wellness dashboard backed by a mock biometric stream.

## Running locally
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. From the project root, start a local server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:8000/Summary.html` (or `User.html`) in your browser.

The mock stream and dashboards will load automatically once served from a local web server.

## Corporate overview demo

The Corporate leadership experience reuses the shared UI token + component system introduced for Wellness.

* Visit [`Corporate.html`](http://localhost:8000/Corporate.html) after starting the server to see the aggregates-only view with KPI tiles, heatmap, detected events, and activity log panels.
* Use the header range controls to flip between the `7d`, `Month`, and `Year` aggregate bundles. The page reacts to `localStorage` updates made anywhere else in the experience via the `hr:range` key.
* Click **Load Night-Shift Scenario** to swap in the prepared `data/scenario/night_shift` data set. Click again (or refresh) to return to the live aggregates.
* Export buttons and filters operate entirely on the aggregate JSON bundlesâ€”no personal data or biosignal payloads are ever loaded.

All Corporate UI panels share the same tokens (colors, radii, shadows, typography) as the Wellness dashboards to guarantee consistency.
