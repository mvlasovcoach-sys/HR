# SPA2099 HR Health Dashboard

## Overview
Static prototype for the SPA2099 HR Health experience, including leadership summary views and a live wellness dashboard backed by a mock biometric stream.

## Running locally
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. From the project root, start a local server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:8000/Summary.html` (or `User.html`) in your browser.

The mock stream and dashboards will load automatically once served from a local web server.
